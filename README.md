# Water Data Analysis Overview

## Dataset Characteristics:

The dataset encompasses crucial water quality parameters, including pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity.
Dealing with Null Values:
To address null values within the dataset, we employed the following strategies:

### Mean Imputation:

Filled missing values with the mean of the respective column.

### Median Imputation:

Utilized the median for imputing null values, providing robustness against outliers.

### Mode Imputation:

Applied mode imputation for categorical data to address missing values.

### Handling Class Imbalance:
To mitigate class imbalance, specifically in predicting water potability, we incorporated the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE):

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):
Generated synthetic samples for the minority class to balance class distribution.
## Machine Learning Algorithms:
A variety of machine learning algorithms were employed for water potability prediction:

### Logistic Regression:

Probability-based model for binary classification.
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Utilized nearest neighbors for classification.
### Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Implemented SVM with a hyperplane to segregate classes.
### Naive Bayes:

Leveraged Naive Bayes assuming feature independence.
### Decision Tree:

Utilized a hierarchical tree structure for decision-making.
### Random Forest:

Employed an ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
Evaluation Metrics:
The performance of each algorithm was assessed using key metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-Score
5. AUC-ROC Curve
## Objective and Conclusion:
This analysis aimed to gain insights into water quality and predict potability. The utilization of various imputation techniques for null values and SMOTE for class imbalance, along with a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, contributes to the robustness of our predictive models. The insights obtained lay the groundwork for ensuring the safety and reliability of water sources.
